# Create NAT instance for VPC

# A NAT instance is an EC2 instance which allows traffic outbound from
# instances in the private network segment. It does the same thing as a NAT
# Gateway, but is much cheaper to run. It has performance limits and
# generally is more trouble to run, but is useful for dev or smaller apps.
