# Create Route53 delgation set
#
# A delegation set is a set of nameservers which will be used when creating a
# zone. It's useful to create it separately from the zone, as you can then
# specify the nameservers for the domain in the registrar and they will stay
# the same even if you delete the Route53 zone and create it again.

# Example config:
# terraform {
#   source = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/modules//route53-delegation-set"
# }
# include {
#   path = find_in_parent_folders()
# }
